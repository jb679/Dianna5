            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>
              70% of adults have experienced some form of trauma. At Awakened
              Energy with Dianna, I am dedicated to your healing, regardless of
              if it’s trauma related, or not. I can’t say it enough…fear does
              not exist. It is an elusive, false-self-limiting belief, which
              creates the emotion for you to experience in the body, keeping you
              stuck in the cycle. Emotions are energy in motion that make up the
              actions we base our decisions around. If you are asleep to them,
              you’re not deciding your life, the illusive beliefs are
              (subconscious.) This energy gets trapped in the body, creating
              disfunction, anxiety, stress, sickness, failed relationships,
              depression, you name it. This energy will continue to manifest
              itself for you to experience until it is released from the
              cellular level. I will guide you through these deeply personal
              false beliefs. You will release the density, creating space within
              you, to receive the light that you are, through the reprogramming
              of the mind. Your life’s experience is valuable, and I desire for
              you to be aware of the decisions you have in each now moment. I
              hold sacred space for your healing. There is a life of abundance
              that awaits you.

            <h2>Dianna's Story</h2>

            <p class="show-sm">
              I instinctively started mindful meditation in 2018. One afternoon
              in 2019, I came out of a meditation, and something “happened.” I
              started to spiritually awaken. All I knew in that moment, is that
              we’re not the mind (ego,) and that we were all connected on a
              deeper level than I had ever experienced before. This “thing,” I
              wasn’t consciously seeking began to unfold because I wasn’t
              seeking it. The awakening wasn’t over. In 2020 I entered a
              relationship and became self-identified with the emotions
              generated, causing me to slip back in ego and not “know” it. I
              didn’t study into the experience to understand it. Not “knowing”
              was the gift for it to unfold perfectly. The relationship came to
              an unexpected, overnight end. This abrupt moment catapulted me
              into the second half of the awakening. The Dark Night of the Soul
              (ego death) was a stage of unimaginable pain and suffering, that
              only the mind could come up with, for the experience to unfold.
              All the ideas I built life around, dissolved and came crumbling
              down to reveal the truth from within. The Divine perfectly timed a
              teacher/healer to appear during this stage of unproportioned
              suffering, Sophie Frabotta. Through her, I received the tools to
              propel out of the dark night, out of the 3D physical world, and
              into 5D. The message was received loud and clear as to the purpose
              on this earth. I dedicate this life to being in service, to raise
              the vibration, show you how to heal at the cellular level, help
              those enter into the new world, and share the wisdom of the
              Universe/Energy/Divine/God knowing within. With Divine Love,
              Dianna
            </p>
            <p class="hide-sm">
              I instinctively started mindful meditation in 2018. I was studying
              about ego, bits and pieces here and there, and had no idea the ego
              and spirituality were related because I knew nothing of
              spirituality. That didn’t matter. If there’s one thing I’ve
              learned, spirituality is not linear and unfolds as it should for
              the growth and highest good for your soul/energy/light’s
              purpose.One afternoon in 2019 I was coming out of a meditation,
              and something changed. I started to awaken. All I knew in that
              moment is that we weren’t the mind (ego.) I knew we were all
              connected on a much deeper level than I had ever known or
              experienced before. This “thing,” I wasn’t even consciously
              seeking, began to unfold because I wasn’t seeking it. In 2020 I
              entered a relationship. I fell so madly in love. I self-identified
              with the emotions generated from this relationship, became
              emotionally attached, causing me to slip back into ego and not
              know it. I didn’t study deep enough into the experience to fully
              understand what occurred. The relationship came to a completely
              unexpected, overnight end. Everything, and everyone I attached
              such strong emotions to…gone. This abrupt moment catapulted me
              into the Dark Night of the Soul. I was suddenly aware of ALL the
              density (negative energy) that did not belong to me. I’d absorbed
              and been holding this stuck energy since birth, combined with the
              ending of a relationship, I truly believed, would last. The Dark
              Night of the Soul was a stage of pain and suffering I could have
              never imagined, existed. All the ideas I built my life around and
              the illusions associated with those ideas came crumbling down and
              fell apart one by one, all the way down to the soul/universal
              level. This is also known as, “ego death.” This was the suffering
              needed to “fully” awaken and become one with the Divine. The
              Divine perfectly timed a teacher/healer to appear for me during
              this stage of suffering. Sophie Frabotta. She gave me the tools to
              propel myself out of the dark night, out of 3D and into 5D. I
              could no longer deny the spiritual calling or stay naive to the
              experiences. The message was received loud and clear as to the
              purpose on this earth. This gift, changed everything, in every
              way. I dedicate this life to being in service to others. I’m here
              to impact the collective, raise the vibration, show you how to
              heal at the cellular level, help those enter the new world, and
              share the wisdom of the Universe/Energy/Divine/God knowing within.

            "I will show you how to enter the space of radical gratitude within,
            which creates a doorway to abundance. Together, we will create the
            life you desire by first, facing the illusions of the past. Emotions
            are nothing more than energy in motion, and this energy gets stuck.
            As you release this stuck energy, it creates space for new
            awareness’s and light to come in. You become clear. You will learn
            to accept your "self" by embracing your heart space. From 3D to 5D
            consciousness."

              If you find yourself slipping back into ego and require alignment,
              I’ve got the tools to keep you aligned. If you believe you are
              spiritually awakening, I’m here to guide you through the
              experience and into alignment! If you believe you are in the dark
              night of the soul (ego death,) I deeply understand the suffering
              associated with this and will give you everything you need to get
              out. You are not alone. Understand the dark night is a process
              that requires an unfolding to take place. The ego death is the
              greatest gift you could ever receive.
